# Intro

I have decided to use this space to present material that I find interesting, as a way to condense and present in an organic form
what I read and learn while tinkering with mathematical models that cross my path.

There will be no specific order or explicit main thread of ideas, at least not by design. I am curious by nature, and my interests
are broad.

I am also a firm believer in serendipity as a driver of discovery. Sometimes one has to simply try and see if something
happens, instead of engineering discovery. Hopefully what I collect here will be useful for other people too!
