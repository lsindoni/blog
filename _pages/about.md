I am a physicist, I worked on classical and quantum gravity problems first at SISSA/ISAS in Trieste,
then as a postdoc at the Albert Einstein Institute (Max Planck Institute for gravitational Physics) in Potsdam.
I worked at InveniaLabs in Cambridge (UK) as a researcher, working mainly on power grids, electricity prices and decision making under uncertainty.
I worked as a model validation specialist at Deutsche Bank in Berlin. Yes, I like to learn new things.
